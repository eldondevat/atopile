# There's gotta be a better way

I'm so lucky my dad taught me the technical details of everything for as long as I can remember. We tore things apart together, fixed things and figured out how to the built world functioned. For my 7th Christmas I got a lawn-mower - to tear the engine off and turn into a go-kart - and I was absolutely stoked.

As [Narayan](/blog/posts/narayans-story) and I grew up, we spent every weekend building things. We were always scheming about the next project, and we were always building something. We built a CNC machine, a liquid-fueled rocket motor, and a drone. We were always trying to make things better, faster, and more efficient. We were always trying to make things work better.
